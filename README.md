# Robots-Dynamics-and-Control

Few examples of Robot Dynamics and Control in Matlab. 

Static equilibrium of serial manipulators covers the basics of force/torque equilibrium for a robotic manipulator, a fundamental concept for dynamic control. 

Recursive Inverse Dynamics is focused on the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for inverse dynamics. 

Dynamic Robot Control is focused on the Dynamic Control of a manipulator.
