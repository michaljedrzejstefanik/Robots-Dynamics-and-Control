In first task I provided torque commands to the robot such that is doesnâ€™t fall due to gravity but holds the initial configuration.

In second task I provided torque commands to the robot in order to reach desired joint configuration.

In third task I provided torque commands to the robot in order to reach desired cartesian configuration.

In fourth task I provided torque commands to the robot in order to reach desired joint configuration with joint trajectory tracking.
