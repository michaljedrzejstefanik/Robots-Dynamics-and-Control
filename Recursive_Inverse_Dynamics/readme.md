In this project I implemented the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for inverse dynamics in Matlab.

In second example I found the inverse dynamics joint torques of RR(2 Rotational Joints) robot in 2 situations.

In third example I found the inverse dynamics joint torques of RP(Rotational Prismatic Joints) robot in 2 situations.
