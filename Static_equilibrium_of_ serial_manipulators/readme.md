In this project I used CAD parts, which parameters were used later in matlab.

First example is a RR(2 Rotational Joints) robot. I computed the robot generalized joint forces, required to balance external forces acting on the robot.

Second example is a PR(Prismatic Rotational Joints) robot. I computed the robot generalized joint forces, required to balance external forces acting on the robot.
